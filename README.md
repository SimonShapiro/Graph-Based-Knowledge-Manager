# Graph-Based-Knowledge-Manager
This project is an experiment in how to set up and use a form of graph-based knowledge representation.  It consists of a number of 
parts that I have been playing with over the past few decades.

It also provides me with a great excuse to learn new technoligies.  Specifically, I have used this project as a vehicle to learn:
* react
* redux
* typescript
* webpack
* pouchdb
